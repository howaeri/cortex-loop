# Research Notes

This directory stores distilled design notes used to guide Cortex implementation.

Scope:

- transferable mechanisms from open-source systems (repo maps, corrective retries, checkpointing)
- graft discipline for deciding what to adapt vs reject
- mission-level inspiration text for maintaining project intent

Privacy rule:

- do not store client/project identifiers or local machine paths in this directory
- keep examples anonymized (`project_a`, `workspace_b`)
- summarize private evidence instead of committing raw artifacts

The files in this folder are curated summaries, not raw source dumps.
